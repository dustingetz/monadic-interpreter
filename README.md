# monadic-interpreter

> a pure functional Lispy implementation

2012 was the Year of the Monad. I wrote this while at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). 
It is a fork of [Lispy](http://norvig.com/lispy.html), I basically took his test cases and wrote a pure 
functional interpreter using monads. I also learned that forcing FP in OOP languages just isn't a good idea :)
